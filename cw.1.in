.SH "NAME"
cw \- colorer for command-line programs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B cw
[\fI\-\-version|\-\-help\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcw\fR colors the output of command-line programs.  The colors applied are based on the definition instructions in a cw executable file.  These definition files appear under the same name as the program they are executing, and are stored in \fB@pkglibexecdir@/\fR.
.SH "DEFINITION INSTRUCTIONS"
The following instructions occur one per line in a definition file.
.TP
\fBcommand\fR [\fIprogram\fR]
specifies a shell command to execute.  "\fB{}\fR" can be used in the \fBprogram\fR string to insert the command\-line arguments.
.TP
\fBifarg\fR [\fIregex:regex:...\fR]
list separated by colons which will be compared against the arguments called to the program.  if the \fBregex\fR matches the arguments, then the definitions to follow will be used\-\-otherwise they will not.  this will continue until the next \fBifarg\fR, \fBifnarg\fR or \fBifarg\-else\fR definition instruction is used.  "\fB<any>\fR" can be used as a constant value for any value, including no value.  "\fB<none>\fR" can be used as a constant value for no command\-line arguments.
.TP
\fBifnarg\fR [\fIregex:regex:...\fR]
reverse of \fBifarg\fR
.TP
\fBifarg\-else\fR
this will use the definitions to follow if the previous \fBifarg\fR or \fBifnarg\fR was false
.TP
\fBifos\fR [\fIregex:regex:...\fR]
list separated by colons which will be compared against the operating system name (equal to uname \-s).  if the \fBregex\fR matches the operating system name, then the definitions to follow will be used\-\-otherwise they will not.  this will continue until the next \fBifos\fR, \fBifnos\fR or \fBifos\-else\fR definition instruction is used.  \fBifos\fR definition instructions are a higher priority than \fBifarg\fR.  "\fB<any>\fR" can be used as a constant value for any value, including no value.
.TP
\fBifnos\fR [\fIregex:regex:...\fR]
reverse of \fBifos\fR
.TP
\fBifos\-else\fR
this will use the definitions to follow if the previous \fBifos\fR or \fBifnos\fR was false
.TP
\fBbase\fR [\fIcolor\fR]
color used if no other definitions state otherwise (if this is the only definition used it will be ignored)
.TP
\fBmatch\fR [\fIbefore color:after color\fR] [\fIregex pattern\fR]
changes the color before and after the \fBregex pattern\fR, if the \fBregex pattern\fR matched output from the program.  be aware that regex matching is the last definition instruction to be compared against output text, as such it can have an adverse effect on the previous (coloring) definition instructions.  see regex(7) for the syntax of regular expressions.
.TP
\fB$\fR[\fIVAR\fR]\fI=\fR[\fIVALUE\fR]
sets the environment variable \fBVAR\fR to \fBVALUE\fR
.TP
\fB#\fR[\fItext\fR]
ignores the following \fBtext\fR for processing. (for comments)
.TP
The color values used are in the text form of:
\fBblack, blue, green, cyan, red, purple, brown, grey+, grey, blue+, green+, cyan+, red+, purple+, yellow, white, default, none\fR
.TP
Colors with a \fB+\fR designate a brighter color.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBNOCOLOR\fR
disables color wrapping when set to any value. Note that cw does not color unless it is connected to a terminal (it detects this separately for standard output and standard error).
.TP
\fBCW_INVERT\fR
re\-defines the internal colormap to the opposite colors.  this is intended to help terminals with white backgrounds become more readable (any value placed in the variable will enable)
