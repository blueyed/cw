.SH "NAME"
cw \- colorer for command-line programs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B cw
[\fI\-\-version|\-\-help\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcw\fR colors the output of command-line programs.
The colors to use are defined by definition scripts, which have the same name as the program they color, and are stored in \fB@pkglibexecdir@\fR.
.PP
\fBcw\fR should not cause any security problems, but since wrapping processes and changing their output can result in subtle bugs, it is not recommended for use by privileged users such as root.
.SH "DEFINITION SCRIPTS"
Definition scripts are written in
.URL "http://www.lua.org/" "the Lua scripting language" ","
but you don't need to know Lua to make a simple script.
To make your own, try first modifying an existing script; remember to make your script executable, and please consider submitting it to the cw maintainer (see
.SM
.BR BUGS )
for inclusion in future releases.
.PP
cw provides scripts with a standard Lua environment, plus \fBluaposix\fR (useful for tasks such as checking the system type and setting environment variables) and the following extra features:
.TP
\fBmatch(\fIclass\fR, \fIpattern\fB)\fR
This function adds a rule to color text matching \fBpattern\fR as class \fBclass\fR.
Matches are applied in order of definition.
See
.SM
.B "CLASSES AND COLORS"
for an explanation of classes, and
.URL "http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1" "the Lua manual" " for the syntax of patterns."
.TP
\fBarg\fR
A list of command-line arguments to the program being colored.
For convenience, each argument is also a key in the table, so it is easy to test whether a certain argument has been given, in any position, with code such as \fBif arg["\-\-help"] then...\fR
.SH CLASSES AND COLORS
.PP
The default classes are: \fBbase, highlight, lowlight, warning, error, punctuation\fR.
The names suggest the sort of text patterns you may want to map to them.
The mapping of classes to colors can be changed with the \fBCW_COLORS\fR environment variable (see
.SM
.BR "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" ).
.PP
The available colors are:
\fBblack, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white\fR.
A color may be prefixed \fBbright\fR to denote a brighter color, e.g. \fBbright red\fR (note the space).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBNOCOLOR\fR
Disables color wrapping when set.
Note that cw disables coloring if standard output is not connected to a terminal, or if the terminal type \fBTERM\fR is \fBdumb\fR.
.TP
\fBCW_INVERT\fR
Inverts the built-in color scheme when set, to make cw more legible on terminals with white backgrounds (cw is set up for a black background by default).
.TP
\fBCW_COLORS\fR
Defines a mapping from classes to colors.
The format is \fBCW_COLORS=class=color\fR[\fB:class=color...\fR].
.SH "RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEFINITION SCRIPTS"
.PP
There are two obvious reasons to color commands: first, for aesthetic reasons, and secondly, to make the output more legible. For the first kind, use your imagination! The colorers provided with cw are of the second kind, and the following suggestions aim to help improve presentation:
.RS
.PP
Colors should be used to pick out key information; it is not necessary to color everything.
.PP
Many commands' output is already clear, and needs little or no coloring. For example, color just the column headings of tables.
.PP
When each line is in the same format, but unaligned, color can be helpful to pick out particular fields; for example, the coloring of variable names in the \fBenv\fR colorer.
.PP
Since \fBcw\fR is not recommended for use by privileged users, don't bother point writing wrappers for commands that typically require administrator privileges to use.
.PP
Help output (e.g. the output of \fB\-\-help\fR) should not be colored.
.PP
Use of the \fBdefault\fR class only makes sense to override the coloring of text that has already been colored by another pattern.
