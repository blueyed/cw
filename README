1. What is cw (color wrapper)?

cw is a non-intrusive real-time ANSI color wrapper for common
non-interactive commands.  cw is designed to simulate the environment
of the commands being executed, so that if a person types 'du', 'df',
'ping', etc. in their shell it will automatically color the output in
real time according to a definition file containing the color format
desired.  cw has support for regex match coloring, case scenario
coloring, command line dependent definition coloring, and includes
over 70 pre-made definition files.


2. How does cw work?

cw works by prepending the a of the cw definition directory to the PATH
environment variable. this is usually set by
"export PATH=/usr/local/libexec/cw:$PATH" (in bash).  in the cw definition
directory you will see file(s) under the very same name of the program
they are designed to color.  these files appear as the common executable
binaries you may be used to using, but they are just text files that
contain instructions for cw to use, including the path to the "real"
binary.


3. How do I install cw?

see the INSTALL file.  note that you need GNU Make to build it.


4. How do I turn cw off?

set NOCOLOR=1 in your environment to turn cw off.


5. Is there a more fine-grained way to turn coloring on and off?

if all the anti-coloring precautions implemented into cw are not
enough, you may make your own program/shell expression to test the 
system environment.  this is done by setting CW_CHK_NOCOLOR="program/
shell expression" in the environment, and if the exit code returned is
non-zero it will disable the coloring.  for example, setting
CW_CHK_NOCOLOR='if [ "`whoami`" = "root" ];then exit 1;fi' would disable
coloring for the root user only.


6. How can I make/modify the coloring of a specific program?

first off I recommend reading the "cw" manpage for a little understanding
of the instructions available to use.  after that it's as simple as opening/
creating the selected definition file (e.g. /usr/local/libexec/cw/df) in your
favorite text editor and making the desired changes.


7. Can curses programs be color wrapped?

not really: cw is only designed for wrapping non-interactive programs.


8. There are too many different colors!

if you find that there are too many color schemes for each program
then you may want to set CW_COLORIZE in your environment.  see the
"cw" manual page for the proper syntax of CW_COLORIZE.


9. My terminal has a white background, why can't I see text?

cw expects a black background by default.  however,  you may set
CW_INVERT=1 in your environment to invert cw's internal colorset.
this will swap black with white and the lighter colors with the darker.
