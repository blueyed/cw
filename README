cw is a colorer for command-line programs.  It is designed to simulate
the environment of the commands being executed, so that when you type
'du', 'df', 'ping', etc. in your shell the output is automatically
colored according to a definition script.  Text patterns are assigned
to lexical classes, which themselves are given colors.  The arguments
to the original program and OS under which it is running can also be
tested.  cw includes over 70 definition scripts, and it's easy to
write more.


Dedicated colorers
------------------

cw doesn't try to replace some dedicated coloring wrappers and
programs, such as:

ccal: for colored calendars
colorgcc: to color the output of gcc
colordiff: to color the output of diff


Installation
------------

First build the program with

  ./configure && make install

or, to install it in your home directory, for example, change the first
part of the command to

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local

cw works by prepending the cw definition directory to the PATH
environment variable.  You should do this in your shell's interactive
startup file (you don't want cw being run by background commands).
For example, for bash and other Bourne-compatible shells, add the
following line to your ~/.bashrc:

  if [ -n "$PS1" ]; then PATH=/usr/local/libexec/cw:$PATH; export PATH; fi

The test of $PS1 ensures that the shell is really interactive.


Use
---

Start a new shell and try some commands, which should now be colored!
Set NOCOLOR=1 in the environment to turn cw off.

cw is set up for a black background by default.  Set CW_INVERT=1 in
the environment to invert cw's default color scheme.

See cw(1) (the cw man page) for more information, including details of
definition scripts.
