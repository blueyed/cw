color wrapper was designed on GNU/linux, but cw is written
in ANSI C and has been ported to several other operating systems.
see PLATFORM for supported operating systems.

what to do:

to install globally (as root):
# ./configure && make install

to install in your home directory:
# ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local && make install

to just compile the binaries:
# ./configure && make

Now please read README if you haven't already.

NOTE: --prefix and --mandir are the only configure arguments
available, despite what the auto-generated ./configure --help says.
